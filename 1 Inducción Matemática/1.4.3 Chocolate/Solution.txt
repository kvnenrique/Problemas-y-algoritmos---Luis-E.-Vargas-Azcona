Consider the next facts about the problem

 a) Each vertical break needs to be performed at least once.
 b) Each horizontal break needs to be performed at least once.
 c) Each vertical break increases by 1 the factor by which 
    next horizontal break must be multiplied.
 d) Each horizontal break increses by 1 the factor by which 
    next vertical break must be multiplied.
 e) If we want to preserve the minimun cost for all breaks, 
    on each break, the next break should be the one that 
    minimizes the sum for all breaks.
 f) Let a,b two numbers (costs), and m,n the factors for which we 
    multiply a and b. Then if a > b,  it implies that:

        a(m) + b(n+1) < a(m+1) + b(n)

    which is obvious if we write the inequality as follows:
        a(m) + b(n) + b < a(m) + b(n) + a

Conclusion

We need to order the breaks by its costs and then perform each break taking  
always the grater cost either vertical or horizontal multiplied by its factor 
that starts at 1, and increasing the factor of the opposite break (horizontal/vertical)
by 1.

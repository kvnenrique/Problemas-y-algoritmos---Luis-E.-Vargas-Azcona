Chocolate

Problem statement

We are given a bar of chocolate composed of m x n square pices. We shold break the chocolate into single squares.
Parts of the chocolate may be broken along the vertical and horizontal lines. A single break of a part of the
chocolate along a chosen vertical or horizontal line divides divides that part in two. Each break of a part of
the chocolate is charged a cost, expressed by a positive integer. This cost does not depend on the size that is
being broken but only depends on the line that break goes along. Let us denote the costs of breaking along
consecutive vertical lines with x1, x2, .. xm-1, and along horizontal lines with y1, y2, ..., yn-1.
The cost of breaking the whole bar into single squares is the sum of the sucessive breaks. One should compute the
minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single single squares.

   x1  x2  x3  x4  x5
-------------------------
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|-----------------------| y1
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|-----------------------| y2
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
-------------------------

For example, if we break the bar first along all horizontal lines, and then each obtained part along the 
vertical lines, then the cost of breaking all the chocolate will be: y1 + y2 + 3(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)

Task

Write a program that: 
 - Reads the values of m x n, and the numbers x1, x2, ..., xm-1 and y1, y2, ..., yn-1.
 - Conputes the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares.

 input

 The firt line of the standar input are two possitive integers m and n, separated by a single space.
 In the sucessive m-1 lines there are the numbers x1, x2, x3 one per line. In the sucessive n-1 lines
 there are the numbers y1, y2, ..., yn-1, one per line.

 E.g:
 3 3
 2
 1
 4
 5

Output
One integer, the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate bar into single squares.

Limits

 2 <= m,n <= 1000
 1 <= xi, yi <= 1000
